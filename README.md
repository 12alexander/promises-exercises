# promises-exercises

Set of exercises in using JS promises for handling asynchronous operations.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to download the Node modules.

## Using

For these exercises, you only need to go the `/answers` directory and implement the functions as directed.  Once correctly implemented, all the test suites should pass.  

* Run `npm test` to run all the test suites.
* Run `npm start` to watch all the test suites.

Or, you can run only the test suites for any exercise using the commands below.

## Outline

* `npm run warmup` - Create promises with Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, and the Promise constructor.
* `npm run and-then` - Use `.then(cb)` and `.catch(cb)` to consume the output of promises, as well as to transform and chain async processes.
